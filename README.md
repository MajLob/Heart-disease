# Heart Disease Analysis
KNN, Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Gaussian Naive Bayes

Analysis of a dataset related to heart disease. The goal is to identify significant patterns, risk factors, and insights that can aid in understanding heart disease trends.

## Project Overview

The dataset includes various medical and demographic features that may contribute to heart disease.

The notebook includes:
1. Data Loading & Preprocessing: Steps to clean and prepare the data for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visual and statistical exploration to understand data distributions and relationships.
3. Data Visualizations: Graphs and plots to illustrate important trends and findings.
4. Feature Engineering: Creation of new features and selection of relevant ones for modeling.
5. Model Training & Evaluation: Application of machine learning models to predict heart disease presence and evaluation of model performance.
